Citizens across the globe spend an increasing proportion of their daily lives on social media websites, such as Twitter and Facebook. Their activities leave behind granular, time-stamped footprints of human behavior and personal interactions that represent a new and exciting source of data to study standing questions about political and social behavior. At the same time, the volume and heterogeneity of social media data present unprecedented methodological challenges. The goal of this short course is to gain the skills necessary to automate the process of downloading, cleaning, and analyzing textual data from social media sites using the R programming language.

# Prerequisites

The course assumes intermediate familiarity with the R statistical programming language. Participants should be able to know how to read datasets in R, work with vectors and data frames, and run basic statistical analyses, such as linear regression. More advanced knowledge of statistical computing, such as writing functions and loops, is helpful but not required.

Students are expected to bring a laptop to class and follow along the coding section of each session.

# Software 

This course will use [R](https://www.r-project.org/), which is a free and open-source programming language primarily used for statistics and data analysis. We will also use [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/), which is an easy-to-use interface to R. 

Installing R or RStudio prior to the workshop is not necessary. The instructor will provide individual login details to an RStudio Server that all workshop participants can access to run their code.
