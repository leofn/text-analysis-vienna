One of the most common applications of dictionary methods is sentiment analysis: using a dictionary of positive and negative words, we compute a sentiment score for each individual document.

Let's apply this technique to tweets by the four leading candidates in the 2016 Presidential primaries.

```{r}
library(quanteda)
tweets <- read.csv('../data/candidate-tweets.csv', stringsAsFactors=F)
```

We will use the LIWC dictionary to measure the extent to which these candidates adopted a positive or negative tone during the election campaign. (Note: LIWC is provided here for teaching purposes only and will not be distributed publicly.) LIWC has many other categories, but for now let's just use `positive` and `negative`

```{r}
liwc <- read.csv("~/data/liwc-dictionary.csv",
                 stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
table(liwc$class)

pos.words <- liwc$word[liwc$class=="positive"]
neg.words <- liwc$word[liwc$class=="negative"]
# a look at a random sample of positive and negative words
sample(pos.words, 10)
sample(neg.words, 10)

```

As earlier today, we will convert our text to a corpus object.

```{r}
twcorpus <- corpus(tweets)
```

Now we're ready to run the sentiment analysis! First we will construct a dictionary object.

```{r}
mydict <- dictionary(list(positive = pos.words,
                          negative = neg.words))
```

And now we apply it to the corpus in order to count the number of words that appear in each category

```{r}
sent <- dfm(twcorpus, dictionary = mydict)
```

We can then extract the score and add it to the data frame as a new variable

```{r}
tweets$score <- as.numeric(sent[,1]) - as.numeric(sent[,2])
```

And now start answering some descriptive questions...

```{r}
# what is the average sentiment score?
mean(tweets$score)
# what is the most positive and most negative tweet?
tweets[which.max(tweets$score),]
tweets[which.min(tweets$score),]
# what is the proportion of positive, neutral, and negative tweets?
tweets$sentiment <- "neutral"
tweets$sentiment[tweets$score<0] <- "negative"
tweets$sentiment[tweets$score>0] <- "positive"
table(tweets$sentiment)
```

We can also disaggregate by groups of tweets, for example according to the party they mention.

```{r}
# loop over candidates
candidates <- c("realDonaldTrump", "HillaryClinton", "tedcruz", "BernieSanders")

for (cand in candidates){
  message(cand, " -- average sentiment: ",
      round(mean(tweets$score[tweets$screen_name==cand]), 4)
    )
}

```

But what happens if we now run the analysis excluding a single word?

```{r}
pos.words <- pos.words[-which(pos.words=="great")]

mydict <- dictionary(list(positive = pos.words,
                          negative = neg.words))
sent <- dfm(twcorpus, dictionary = mydict)
tweets$score <- as.numeric(sent[,1]) - as.numeric(sent[,2])

for (cand in candidates){
  message(cand, " -- average sentiment: ",
      round(mean(tweets$score[tweets$screen_name==cand]), 4)
    )
}

```

How would we normalize by text length? (Maybe not necessary here given that tweets have roughly the same length.)

```{r}
# collapse by account into 4 documents
twdfm <- dfm(twcorpus, groups = "screen_name")
twdfm

# turn word counts into proportions
twdfm[1:4, 1:10]
twdfm <- dfm_weight(twdfm, scheme="prop")
twdfm[1:4, 1:10]

# Apply dictionary using `dfm_lookup()` function:
sent <- dfm_lookup(twdfm, dictionary = mydict)
sent
(sent[,1]-sent[,2])*100

```
